<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>:—<i>You are looking into the study of a
Scientist—a large room lined with books and specimen cases.
At the back are two upright windows, through which one sees
a green bowery garden, suggestive of quiet and seclusion.
In one window stands a case of stuffed birds, in the other
a microscope. Near the center of the room is a ponderous
writing-table, above which hangs an adjustable light, presided
over by a large green shade. Adjoining the writing-table is a
smaller one, on which stands a typewriter. All about the room,
on tables and systematically arranged, and suggestive of the
strict order imposed by a meticulous mind. There is one door to
right, another to left, the latter leading to an inner chamber.
On the writing-table lie papers and a portable speaking-tube.
A telephone, a waste-paper basket, and a revolving book-stand
are within easy reach of the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor’s</span> <i>chair,
while behind it is a screen partly covering the door leading
to the inner chamber. On the opposite side, between the other
door and the window, stands a large chest. It is morning,
and through half-lowered green blinds sunlight streams over
the replete and comfortable interior, touching to brightness
the polished metal of the microscope, and the plumage of the
stuffed birds.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>At the small table, on a chair less comfortable than the
one at the writing-desk sits an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span> old gentleman in an affluent
dressing-gown of deep rich tones, dividing his attention
between a bowl of “Benger’s Food” and the typewriter, at
which he clicks with portentous gravity and occasional pauses
in the fingering. He is evidently inexpert, perhaps through
short-sightedness; but the typewriter helps him to feel, even
in his study, that his words are destined for print and the
laying-down of the scientific law for the generations to come
after.</i></p>

<p><i>The clock on the chimney-piece, a skeleton of severe
design, with the workings of its metal bowels immodestly
exposed, strikes eleven. This seems to be a signal to a mind
methodically trained. The</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>consults
his watch, starts, looks reproachfully at the clock, then quits
the typewriter, picks up his bowl of Benger, and spooning
from it on the way goes to the speaking-tube, which having
unstopped, he breathes into. The exertion sets him coughing;
but he does this, like most other things, patiently and
methodically. After listening at the tube he speaks down it,
and you hear a bisected conversation.</i></p>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Professor Braintree.</span> Is that you, Miss Tuckey?—Yes, I’m
ready for you—I’m ready, I say—if you will, please. Yes. (<i>He
starts to put on the stopper again; then, as an after-thought</i>)—Oh!
Miss Tuckey—Are you there?—Tut! Tut! Why does the woman hurry so?
(<span class="smcap">He</span> <i>gets up a little testily to remove his Benger bowl to a
side-table, and progressing with very short steps places it unsecurely
on a projecting book whence it falls and breaks</i>. <span class="smcap">He</span>
<i>accepts the fact philosophically so far as infirmity will allow; but
there is a gentle querulousness in his tone as he says—</i>) There,
there! Oh dear!—(<i>And leaving the fragments to lie, returns to his
place. There he stands for a moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> and looking back reproachfully,
removes from his eyes the highly magnifying reading-glasses which were
the cause of the mishaps. He replaces them by another pair which permit
a wider range of vision. Through these he is able to contemplate the
entrance of</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey</span>, <i>a subdued machine of a woman
who accepts, without kick of any kind, the mould she has been poured
into.)</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> Good-morning, Sir.</p>


<p class="hang">(<i>Like a well-fed fish catching at a fly from mere habit,
the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>engulfs and returns the
salutation by an inaudible movement of the lips</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Miss Tuckey, there is something broken over there,
will you please see it removed? And will you kindly make a note to
write to Messrs. Spink and Wedge, and say that these new glasses don’t
suit me—I find them very trying to the—(<i>About to say “temper,” he
substitutes</i>)—to the eyes. And I must ask you to fetch those proofs
which came yesterday. I tried to catch you just now, but you had gone.</p>


<p class="hang">(<i>In this statement there is a note of rebuke for a too
precipitate obedience to summons. But by the foresight of</i>
<span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey</span>, <i>the proofs are there; she deposits
them in front of him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Oh, very well. Thank you. Any letters? (<i>Those
also she deposits, in two heaps, the business ones opened, the private
and personal untouched</i>) When did these come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> Most of them last night, sir, after you had gone
to bed.</p>


<p class="hang">(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span>, <i>tentatively inspecting them,
remembers that he must change his glasses again. The magnifying
lens proves informative.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Ah! here is one from Miss Elfrida, I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> (<i>As she collects and removes the fragments of
the Benger’s Food bowl</i>) That only came this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Wasn’t she to be back to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> Yes. They are expecting her quite soon. About
twelve, I believe. (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>looks at his
watch, and then remembers that he has fault to find with the clock, and
incidentally with her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> That clock is three quarters of a minute slow, Miss
Tuckey. (<span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey</span> <i>at once goes to correct it</i>) It
should now be at four and a quarter minutes past. A clock that loses
time is so disturbing—especially when it strikes. It puts me out of my
stride for the rest of the day. (<span class="smcap">He</span> <i>begins looking at his
correspondence</i>) And now, if you will attend to <i>me</i>! (<span class="smcap">Miss
Tuckey</span> <i>is already standing meekly to attention</i>) You have
your notebook?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Take this, then! (<span class="smcap">He</span> <i>consults
once more the letter which he has picked up from his opened
correspondence</i>)—“Mr. James Pomeroy.” (I <i>think</i> it is
Pomeroy)—He writes on good note-paper with a crest; I suppose I must
answer him. “Dear Sir”—Oh! while I think of it, make a note that the
extra plates for the new edition of “Objective Science” have not come
through as advised; and they must not go to press till I have passed
them. What have you got?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> “Mr. James Pomeroy, Dear Sir.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> No, better make it “Sir.” These parasitic
correspondents ought not to be encouraged. “I beg to acknowledge
receipt”—no, “I <i>have</i> to acknowledge”—<i>have</i>—“the receipt
of your letter”—date so and so. “With the proposition therein set
forth, I cannot find myself in agreement. The limits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> of sensory
receptivity are patent to every scientist.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> The limits of what?—I beg pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> “Sen-sory re-ceptivity”—in other words, the
receptivity of the senses. “That fact, however, does not provide
any legitimate ground for a belief in those magical or supernatural
occurrences through which, as I apprehend, you seek to counter-balance
the deductions of science. I find no reason to doubt that however
much still lies beyond the apprehension of our senses, it must all
nevertheless be within the range of a scientific explanation. I am,
Sir, yours faithfully”—(<i>He takes up another letter</i>) Oh,
that is from Messrs. Moody &amp; Prose. Just say “received,” and have
made a note. This is to take the chair at the International Science
Conference for the discussion on the “Homology of the Invertebrates.”
Say I accept the honor and am their obedient servant—That is, no.
That is “no”—(<i>He hands letter</i>) That impertinence you need not
answer—And now, take this—“Mrs. Daphnephoria Brown—the Seminary,
Brunswickville, Connecticut”—“My Dear Madam, Your very flattering
proposal to arrange a compendium from my various studies in Objective
Science, entitled ‘Sufficient unto the Day,’ and intended to provide
a basis for the accurate biological training of the very young, gives
gratifying evidence of the interest you take in and the value which you
attach to my literary labors. I am inclined, however, to think that
the terminological exactitude so necessary to scientific statement
could not be accommodated to the range of the child-mind without a
certain damage to the content”—Of course, that means to the scientific
content, not to the child’s mind. No, no, don’t take that! That was
only commentary—“Should I, on later consideration, see any possible
adjustment of my works to your proposed scheme I shall not fail to
communicate with you further in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span> matter. I am, dear Madam, yours
very truly”—That you can destroy, and the address you need not keep.
(<span class="smcap">He</span> <i>hands over the letter to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey</span>)
And I think that is all—Oh, will you fetch me the file of Professor
Lake Jones’ articles on the “Rudiments of Corpuscular Gravity” which
appeared in last year’s “Science Journal.” You will find it in the
Press Bureau, I think, under “R.” (<span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey</span> <i>goes to
look for the file in the small inner chamber, from which, as she opens
the door, comes a brighter light of day than enters the study through
the tempering green blinds</i>) And now for Elfrida. (<i>He opens
letter</i>) Well, well, well! What is she sending me this botanical
specimen for, I wonder? It looks like a leaf of the Hornbean—Carpinus
Betulus, if I am not mistaken. (<i>He examines the leaf, then lays
it down and returns to the letter</i>) Dear me! The child has such a
hand-writing that I can’t read a word of it. Miss Tuckey, your eyes are
better than mine, will you kindly read me this letter?</p>


<p class="hang">(<span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey</span> <i>has returned with the required file.
She puts it down and takes up the letter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> “Dearest Grandpapa”——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Yes, yes, I read that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> “I am coming back to-morrow—I have had a lovely
time. So did Benjy: we went everywhere together, but he always would go
into the water, and I had to stay out——”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Benjy is the dog, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> “That was wrong of him, wasn’t it?— To-day in
the wood I saw a tree full of fairies, it was wonderful. But when I
came they all climbed up and hid behind the leaves, so I wasn’t able to
catch one. But I send you a leaf off the tree, so as to show it was a
real one, and not what you call my ‘magination’——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Oh, so that’s what the botanical specimen is for,
is it?—Yes?——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> “Please keep it till I come, then I will tell you
all about it——”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Miss Tuckey, I wish you would not leave that door
open! There’s a dreadful draught at my back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tuckey.</span> It isn’t open sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Well, there’s a draught somewhere—Quite a wind!
It seemed to come all of a sudden; and there! it has blown away Miss
Elfrida’s leaf that was here a moment ago. (<span class="smcap">He</span> <i>friggles and

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Yes, yes. But there will be a reaction. That will pass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> But—Doctor—I’m not satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> You will be. Don’t dwell on it! You’ll get all right
again. Don’t work too much at night, and don’t sit up late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> I go to bed regularly every night at a quarter to
ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Good! Then just for the present make it half-past nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Doctor, I want to explain— At first, of course,
I took the view that <i>you</i> take. I did not for a moment believe
that such a thing could exist. I regarded it as an hallucination. But
later on, it—well I came to think otherwise—It did such a lot of
things—that I could not myself have conceived—and once it actually
touched me. That was a great shock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Yes, it would be, naturally. But you were indulging
the——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> No, no, Doctor, I was <i>not</i>. I— Well, now
what I want to tell you is this. When I began to think that there was
something real about it after all, I—then, I’m sorry to say, I let
myself go, and I pursued it—all over the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Any good?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> None whatever. I knocked over a few things, that’s
all. I was picking them up just before you came in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Well, and then?</p>


<p class="hang">(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Professor’s</span> <i>eye travels toward the
chest; but he is unable to confess himself quite honestly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Then—it disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> And you haven’t seen it since?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Nor heard it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> I have not—. That is, <i>no</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Well, then, that’s all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> I hope so. Doctor, I haven’t quite explained to
you the shock it was to me. It was that terrible moment when I thought
that, after all, there might be something in it! At that moment I saw
all my life’s work disappear. All my science, all my philosophy—gone!
Everything I had written—worth nothing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Well, well, but don’t dwell on it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> It was terrible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> But it wasn’t true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> No— But for a moment it seemed true. That is
really what—what gave me such a shock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Well, it’s over. Now, don’t think any more of it. That
is the best cure. You say you haven’t been sleepless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> No—but I shall be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Oh, no. We’ll see to that! I’ll send you the right
thing. To-night you’ll sleep like a top. (<i>He gets up to go.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Thank you. Good-bye. (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>
<i>starts to go</i>) You don’t think that I’m really off my head, do
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> No, no, Nerves a little bit upset, that’s all!—a
little too much work, a little too much sitting still, a little too
much indoors—and a little too much green tea. Many a little makes a
mickle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> I don’t want it to occur again, Doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> It shan’t, sir, it shan’t! Now, good-bye; I must be
off!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Thank you. Good-bye. (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>
<i>goes out. The</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>stands looking at the
chest</i>) And to think how I saw it go in there! (<i>He goes and
stands by the chest; listens for a long time, then taps</i>) Is
anyone—?—Is anything there?—Ah! That’s all right, then!—I hope.
(<i>He goes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> back to his seat. Then his eye falls on the key; he takes
hold of it, and is about to get up again. With an effort he sits back,
letting the key go</i>) No, I will not!— But suppose—suppose it were
there after all! No, no, no—. It wouldn’t do at all. Everybody would
think that I was mad— Well, I must—I must try to get on with my work.
(<i>He composes himself to write. Presently there enters an attractive
little figure in a knitted cap, jersey, and skirt of bright green. This
is</i> <span class="smcap">Elfrida</span>. <i>She advances very quietly, with a roguish
smile, stops at the table and stands looking at him. Suddenly, with the
tail of his eye, the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>catches sight of her.
It gives him a dreadful start; but a look at her over the top of his
glasses reassures him</i>) Effie! Why, Effie, my dear, what a start you
gave me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> (<i>Getting nearer the truth than she knows</i>) You
thought I was a fairy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> No, I didn’t think you were a fairy. I thought you
were an hallucination!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Something that’s not real, my dear.</p>


<p class="hang">(<span class="smcap">Elfrida</span> <i>has sidled round to the back of his chair;
and now, from behind, she gives him an affectionate hug.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> <i>I’m</i> real.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Thank God for that!— Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> Oh, Grandpapa, I’ve had such a lovely time! You got
my letter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Yes, my dear— Oh, by the way, you’ve come just too
late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> The Doctor, my dear. I wanted him to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> To tell me how you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> But I’m quite well—ever so well!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> I hope so, my dear, but one never knows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> <i>I</i> do! And Grandpapa, you got my present,
didn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Your present?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> In my letter—What came off the tree that had fairies
in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Oh, yes, yes. It’s somewhere about here. (<i>He
starts to search, then remembers</i>) Oh, no! It blew away:—it’s on
the floor somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> And you <i>do</i> believe what I told you—don’t you,
Grandpapa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Well—I’ve thought about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> It was <i>true</i>— I <i>saw</i> them! You must
believe that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Well, I don’t know— One isn’t sure. So you’ve had
a good time, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> Grandpapa— If you could only make people <i>know</i>
there were fairies, wouldn’t it be wonderful?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> I suppose it would be, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> But no one believes in them now, do they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> No, not usually.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> Grandpapa, if you were ever able to find
one—wouldn’t it be grand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Would it, my dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> Did you ever try?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Once I did, for a short time. But if I were to, no
one would believe me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> Oh, but if you found it and showed it to them, they’d
have to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Yes, I suppose they would, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> And then you’d be ever such a great person—much
greater than you are now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> But my dear, you—you don’t understand. If people
were told that Professor Braintree believed in fairies—why, they would
<i>laugh</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> You’d laugh, too—but you could laugh longer than
they would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> Why, it would be like a miracle! People would begin
to <i>love</i> fairies again, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Well—perhaps. Green isn’t my favorite color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> It’s funny your saying that! The fairy <i>I</i> saw
was green.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Was it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> And it had long horns, and its mouth and eyes
were just like a young bird’s (<i>This almost startles the</i>
<span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>out of his skin. Blinking and munching, he
sits staring, while</i> <span class="smcap">Elfrida</span> <i>continues to deal her
devastating blows</i>) And it ran round behind the tree, and when I got
there, it was gone. If you’d been there, Grandpapa, to run round the
other way——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Run round?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> And if you’d had your butterfly net—(<i>This gives
the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>a fresh jerk</i>) Why, we could have
caught it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Well, I’m not so sure—? Perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> But, Grandpapa, you <i>are</i> believing what I tell
you, aren’t you?— I saw it—<i>really</i> I did!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> I would like to believe it, my dear—It would make
a great difference to my state of health. When you saw it, didn’t it
upset you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> It didn’t frighten you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> No! Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Not even when you ran after it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> Why, no! Of course it ran, too. But it was quite nice
about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Was it, indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> It made a noise at me—just like a bird—a nice bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Did it say “Sick, sick, sick, sick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> No; it only went “Chewee! Chewee!”—just like that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Then I’m <i>not</i> mad after all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> Grandpapa, what’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> My dear—you would really <i>like</i> to see
that—that thing again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> Why, yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Green, and with horns, and eyes?—Hear it again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Run after it again?—with a butterfly net?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> And catch it? Oh, yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Well, my dear, there’s—there’s no accounting for
tastes. But I begin to think that I’m not so mad as I thought I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> I never thought you were mad, Grandpapa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Thank you, my dear. I’m glad of that— Now, look
here, you see that chest? This is the key to it— Now, will you go and
open it? And don’t be afraid of anything you find in it—It’s all right.</p>


<p class="hang">(<span class="smcap">Elfrida</span> <i>goes and opens the chest. And while she
stands for a moment looking in, nonplussed, there is much more
excitement in the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor’s</span> <i>demeanor than in
hers.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> But, Grandpapa, there’s nothing! Oh! (<i>At
this cry of discovery the strain on the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor’s</span>
<i>feelings grows intense.</i> <span class="smcap">Elfrida</span> <i>stoops and picks up
something</i>) Why, it’s the <i>leaf</i>!—The leaf of that tree what I
sent you!— Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> The leaf, you say?— Bring it here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> And it’s all quite withered and dead! (<i>She brings
it across to him, and the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>looks at it with
curious eyes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> So it is, to be sure!— Quite withered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span> and dead.
Well, there! Put it down, my dear, leave it alone!— And now you had
better run away. I must get on with my work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elfrida.</span> What shall I do with it, Grandpapa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor.</span> Put it in the waste-paper basket, my dear!— That’s
right. Now, run away!</p>


<p class="hang">(<i>And so the dead leaf drops to its repose on a bed of
scrapped science shiftings. From that fairy-funeral</i>
<span class="smcap">Elfrida</span> <i>turns, down-cast and sad, and with head
bent and hands straight as though under some deep disgrace,
goes softly out of the room. As the door closes behind her
the</i> <span class="smcap">Professor</span> <i>gives a look into the waste-paper
basket, then heaves a sigh of relief, and goes on with his
work.</i>)</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
